			<h2>Myers-Briggs Personality Test</h2>
			<p>
				Based on the Myer-Briggs personality test, there are a number of similarities that are shared across the team. <br>
				James is an INTP-T while Andrew is an INTJ-A. <br>
				The key characteristics that shared between the two are both of us are: 
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Introverted in nature, requiring time to consider our ideas and validate our thinking process</li>
					<li>Capable of working autonomously to complete the work with little direction </li>
					<li>Analytical and like the creativity aspect of solving problems </li>
					<li>Distracted easily when the discussion is not of interest or unfocused at the task at hand</li>
					<li>Distracted easily when the discussion is not of interest or unfocused at the task at hand</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				While these profiles share common elements, there are differences too. This includes: 
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An INTJ-A tends to rely on data and facts to make decisions, an INTP-T is comfortable moving forward with making decisions based on the evidence at hand and their feelings.</li>
					<li>An INTJ-A likes to work in a structured environment surrounding them and builds a plan, whereas an INTP-T can find structure in their own work</li>
					<li>An INTJ can be direct in their communication and dealings with others, while an INTP can come across as more easy-going and good-natured in their approach. </li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				In working together as a team, we need to be mindful of not working autonomously. It will be important to set up an operating rhythm in which the work is allocated between each other and we know what needs to be delivered. 
				It will be necessary to make sure that we collectively share our ideas and mutually agree on the decisions made from a project delivery perspective.

			<h2>Learning Styles</h2>
			<p>
				The learning styles are quite different between the team members. James is predominately a Reflector, while Andrew is a Pragmatist. <br>
				As a reflector, James is a cautious learner. He likes to take his time to collect and analyse information to reach a conclusion. James does not necessarily need to put into action what he has learned to feel comfortable. <br>
				Andrew’s dominant learning style is quite the opposite of James. To take in the information and understand it, Andrew finds it necessary to observe and learn in the real world instead of practice the theory. <br>
				As we work together, we will need to be more conscious of our learning styles to ensure that we understand the work that needs to be delivered and how we can support each other through the various activities that are to be completed.
