			<h1>Triggered Reports - Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h1>
			<h2>5.2.1	What does it do? </h2>
			<h3>Blockchain </h3>
			<p>
				Blockchain is a distributed public technology ledger that can transform how individuals interact with one and another. It facilitates more than just cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain tracks, records and exchanges anything of value. This can include medical records, property titles and equity. <br>
				Each block within the chain are made up of 3 core elements: <br>
				<b>Data</b> – Details relating to the transaction  <br>
				<b>Hash</b> – A unique identifier that identifies the block and its content; and, <br>
				<b>Hash</b> of the previous block – A unique identifier that links the last transaction together with the blockchain. <br>
				Blockchain is considered to be a secure and safe environment to exchange transactions. <br>
				It operates on a peer to peer network without a centralised governing body. Each transaction that is performed in a blockchain is digitally timestamped and verified. Once the block within the chain is created, it cannot be retrospectively altered as all the other blocks in the chain would need to be updated and accepted by the network.<br> 
				The exchange of data between the individuals is actioned through the use of blockchain keys. Each user is issued with two keys; public and private key, which are mathematically linked through cryptography. <br>
				A public key is a unique identifier that identifies a user in the public domain. A user will initiate a transaction using their public key and send it to another user’s public key. The receiving user’s private key will be used to unlock it to accept and access the transaction. This private key is only known to the user. <br>
			</p>
			<h3>Cryptocurrencies </h3>
			<p>
				Cryptocurrencies are a digital currency used as a medium to exchange a transaction of value between users online. The exchange value is supported through the use of blockchain technology. <br>
				Like blockchain, cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralised environment with no need for a third-party intermediary like a bank or stock exchange to support the transaction. As a result of removing these intermediaries, the exchange of value between two users can be completed more efficiently and securely. <br>
				While cryptocurrencies are not widely accepted and used in our economy today, their value has steadily appreciated since their introduction in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Many investors view cryptocurrencies as the currency of the future as they are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Low-cost model to exchange value </li>
				<li>Greater security and privacy </li>
				<li>Faster exchange of value with the between to users: and, </li>
				<li>Potential a global currency to exchange good and services </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The adoption of cryptocurrencies is also being held back by regulatory challenges. The exchange of value between users can occur with a level of anonymity and lack of traceability. This creates barriers for government agencies to stop illegal trade, anti-money laundering and tax evasion. 
				Governments worldwide will need to adapt their policy to ensure their countries' interests are protected and that their nations can continue to prosper. <br>
				Technology infrastructure also acts as an inhibitor for the adoption of cryptocurrencies within the general economy. As the blockchain ledgers continue to grow with increasing demand, it will become increasingly difficult to download and update these ledgers consistently with each transaction. Significant hardware capability would also be required to ensure that they have been recorded and verified accurately within the blockchain. 
			</p>
			<h2>5.2.2	What is the likely impact? </h2>
			<h3>Blockchain </h3>
			<p>
				The use of blockchain will disrupt the way that data is shared within the economy. It will be seen as a more secure way to share information that creates an audit trail that cannot be corrupted. While widely used today to support the exchange of cryptocurrencies between users, the technology can be further expanded to disrupt and transform other traditional business models.<br>
				Financial services are one particular industry where blockchain will have a significant impact on their operating model. In a report commissioned in 2017 by Chartered Accountants, it identified that banks could save a potential $15 billion  annually in infrastructure costs by using a distributed ledger technology. These changes would significantly impact their workforces who support the ongoing maintenance and development of the IT infrastructure.<br> 
				It may also make some services and products they distribute redundant as blockchain can deliver the same outcome faster and more efficiently. The exchange of shares and property settlements are perfect examples. 
			</p>
			<h3>Cryptocurrencies </h3>
			<p>
				With further technological advances and tight regulatory controls governing cryptocurrencies, it has the potential to have a significant impact on our social and economic well-being. As it operates in a decentralised model and is facilitated through a peer-to-peer network, the way that value is exchanged in the economy would radically change. <br>
				Cryptocurrencies have the ability:  
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Challenge the US dollar as being the reserve currency of the world, impacting the value of debt held by major global economies</li>
				<li>Dimmish the role that third-party intermediaries, like the banks, play in facilitating the movement of money within the economy </li>
				<li>Transform how equity is raised by businesses to fund their ongoing development and expansion. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Long term, these changes would have a significant impact on many people and the roles they play in the economy. Jobs like Bankers, Global Investment Brokers and Foreign Exchange Dealers could be reduced or made redundant. 
			</p>
			<h2>5.2.3	How will this affect you?  </h2>
			<p>
				In the immediate to near future, I do not believe the blockchain and cryptocurrencies will significantly impact my way of life or those surrounding me. The technology is not widely accepted and there are still significant infrastructure and regulatory changes that need to be overcome before it is meaningful to our daily lives. <br>
				With advancements in technology in the future, both may impact the way we exchange value. This includes: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Becoming an integral part of my investment and savings strategy  </li>
				<li>Reducing our reliance on using a bank or financial institution </li>
				<li>Exchanging value for the purchase of a new home or car using the technology. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I also work in the financial services industry. These changes would have an impact on my role and the projects that I delivered at my employer. Learning more about Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies reinforces my need to continually update my skills to adapt and grow as these changes further disrupt the global economy.
