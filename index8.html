			<h1>Triggered Reports - Robots</h1>
			<h2>5.4.1	What does it do? </h2>
			<p>
				A robot, depending on who you ask, can mean different things. A robot is primarily used to perform repetitive actions longer, faster, more efficient and accurate than a human could in the same situation. A robot has the following characteristics: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is usually a mechanical construction </li>
				<li>It requires electrical components to power and control the machinery </li>
				<li>It contains some level of computer programming to tell the machine what to do 
			<p>
				There are different types of robots such as pre-programmed robots, teleoperated robots and autonomous robots. 
				Pre-programmed robots are usually used it factories and assembly lines, as they are designed to do complete one action. 
				Teleoperated robots are robots that can be controlled by a human through radio control, and are usually used in extreme geographical locations where the human body cannot survive in safely. 
				Autonomous robots are able to act independently and can carry out a wide range of tasks without human supervision. <br>
				Things that can be considered robots are quite common in our everyday lives. An example of a pre-programmed robot would be those used to assemble cars in a factory. 
				They perform spot welding and spray painting, as well as other tasks that could be dangerous for humans such as repetitive heavy lifting. 
				An example of a teleoperated robot would be bomb disposal robots that are deployed whenever there is a bomb threat by the local police bomb squads. 
				The human bomb disposal expert is kept safe by being away from the bomb while they guide the robot towards the bomb via radio control and attempt to disarm the bomb so it can be safely removed. 
				The Roomba, an autonomous robot vacuum cleaner, is able to perform its task of sucking up dirt, dust and other particles from the floor of a room without the need for a human to guide it. 
				It has a computer with uses its sensors to ensure that the entire floor of the room has been cleaned, and it able to determine whether any particular spot requires extra work without a human to guide it. 
				Another example of an autonomous robot would be a passenger airliner, for example an Airbus 380. 
				Its autopilot function meets the definition listed above. Once the pilot in command sets up the target height, target speed and/or target rate of climb or descent (if used to gain height or lose height), t
				he autopilot uses the sensors installed throughout the aircraft to sense the environment, has a computer that uses the information to make decisions and the executes the action autonomously to ensure that the aircraft flies at the settings laid out by the pilot in command. <br>
				As the technology develops and improves, what defines a robot will change as well. In the future, robots are expected to be capable of autonomous action through improvements in artificial intelligence by sensing its environment, carry out computations to make decisions and perform actions in the real world. As robots become more intelligent, they will be able to complete a wider range of tasks such as self-driving vehicles, autonomous letter and parcel delivery and even provide care and companionship as caregivers to elderly people. 
			</p>
			<h2>5.4.2	What is the likely impact? </h2>
			<p>
				As robots become more intelligent, the way they can be used will expand greatly and into many industries, both to complement the human at their job or outright replace the human. 
				Jobs where the robot would replace the human would be those that are considered low skilled, repetitive and labour-intensive jobs such as warehouse order picking. 
				While it is inevitable that robots will replace humans in some jobs, there are many more jobs where robots will be used to supplement the human. 
				The use of robots to complement the human is already beginning, with examples such as collaborative robots (cobots) used in medicine where an expert surgeon uses the cobot to make surgeries safer and more precise. Another example where robots complement the human is in education, as the robot can help enhance the learning experience by developing new ways of understanding and learning. <br>
				The vast use of robots through all the different industries will create many jobs that humans are more suitable for. First and foremost, there would be an increased demand for software developers, as all robots operate based on instructions set out in their software. 
				As more robots enter various industries to work, more software developers will be required to continue to develop, support and update software to perform more and more tasks, whether it is to complement a human or operate autonomously. There will also be increased demand for data analysists, as the robots will generate lots of performance-related data which will require interpreting, assessing and analysing to improve existing operations. 
				As more jobs require robots in various degrees, more maintenance crews will be required to ensure that robots of all kinds are kept in good condition to continue to perform their tasks so that businesses don’t become crippled when a robot no longer functions as intended. 
			</p>
			<h2>5.4.3	How will this affect you? </h2>
			<p>
				As robot technology continues to improve, the number of roles a robot will be able to fulfill will continue to increase. They already have an impact in our everyday lives, helping humans take care of some mundane household chores such as vacuuming with the introduction of the autonomous vacuuming robot, allowing the human to have more time to pursue their own interests. In the work place, the increasing usage of robots across multiple industries will improve the efficiency of the task at hand, and more repetitive jobs can be passed to the robot, freeing up the human to focus on other tasks where a human’s creativity can potentially lead to breakthroughs in problem solving. <br>
				When the technologies mature enough to make autonomous vehicles a viable product, the way humans travel on road will undergo a drastic change, where the human could potentially turn their attention elsewhere while in a car without having to worry about crashing, allowing the human to be more efficient with the time they have. The eventual introduction of robotic caregivers and household assistants will lead to an improved quality for life, especially for elderly people who live alone and families with children. For the elderly, the caregivers will be able to assist them by doing things the elderly person would struggle with, such as opening doors, reaching for items in higher places. 
				The caregivers can also act as health monitors to ensure the elderly under their care is healthy and request medical assistance should it be required and most importantly, provide the elderly person a certain level of companionship so they won’t feel too lonely. For families with children, the household assistant can help look after the child, provide them with entertainment and assist in the child’s education through interactive educational games. <br>
				The increasing usage of robots will improve the humans quality of life by taking care of repetitive, low skilled tasks in various work places, freeing up the human to use their creativity in areas that is needed, and by taking care of the elderly so they will not have to live with a reduced quality of life due to the deterioration of their body by assisting them with tasks they are no longer able to do.
