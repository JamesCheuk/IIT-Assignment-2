			<h2>What common elements are there, if any?</h2>
			<p>
				Overall, there are no significant common elements between a Mid-Senior Unity Developer and that of a Service Design Lead based on the skills and experience outlined in both of the job advertisements. 
				Both are fundamentally different in in their purpose and what they need to achieve. <br>
				There are three key elements that they do share in common. They are:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Agile Delivery</li>
					<p>Agile is a set of principles and values shared amongst a team to form a framework to work together to deliver a solution of value to the customer.</p>
					<li>Problem Solving </li>
					<p>The ability to define a problem and constructively work to develop options to reduce or remove its impact. </p>
					<li>Web Development</li>
					<p>The knowledge and skillset to design and stand-up a website to be used by an end customer. </p>
				</ul>

			<h2>What differentiates each position from the others, if any?</h2>
			<p>
				The focus of a Service Design Lead is entirely different from that of a Mid-Senior Level Gaming Developer. <br>
				As a Service Design Lead, the role is heavily research-focused. Working with customers and/or focus groups, you must gather key data points from them to define their problems and identify solutions to the products and services they use. <br>
				Applying the principles of design thinking, a Service Design Lead will take the customer through five process stages to develop a solution: 
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Empathy – Understand the problem from a human context</li>
					<li>Define – Research the problem </li>
					<li>Ideation – Develop ideas that will to resolve the problem </li>
					<li>Prototype – Create basic solutions (wireframes, models) that can be tested quickly</li>
					<li>Test – Tests the solution to ensure that it meets the customers’ needs or iterates it further based on their feedback. </li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				A Service Design Lead is not necessarily a technical role. Based on the research gathered, it documents the requirements that a solution architect and developer will use to develop a solution to solve a customer’s problem. <br>
				The role of a Mid-Senior Level Gaming Developer is quite different in that they are responsible for developing a game's technical elements. 
				They require component skills in several different development languages, architecture structures, and platforms to develop a concept from an idea into a full working gaming solution for general public use.

			<h2>How similar are your career plans across the group?</h2>
			<p>
				From a group perspective, the career plans shared within the group are quite different from one another. They are focused on a different perspective of technology and product development. <br>
				As a Service Design Lead, there is a heavy emphasis on developing solutions to improve services to customers and enhance product offerings. These roles can extend beyond just the aspect of technology. 
				This includes the elements of people and processes to develop full end-to-end solutions. Service Design roles are now being used in major companies to simplify their engagement with customers and create compelling product propositions. <br>
				A Mid-Senior Unity Game Developer focus is quite technical. It is responsible for developing a computer game's technical aspects to create a unique offering that a human-being engages with for entertainment.
