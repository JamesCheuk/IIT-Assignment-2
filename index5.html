			<h1>Triggered Reports - Machine Learning</h1>
			<h2>5.1.1	What does it do?  </h2>
				<p>
					Machine Learning is a component of artificial intelligence that enables systems to self-learn based on the data it consumes. 
					Using sophisticated algorithms, these machines are continually learning by analysing the data they collect, identify patterns, store it for future use, and provide a predictive outcome for the user based on their request. <br> 
					There are three different types of Machine Learning; Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.  
				</p>
				<h5>Supervised Learning</h5>
				<p>
					A labeled data set is input into the machine to help it identify patterns, sort information and label new data as it is received.   
				</p>
				<h5>Unsupervised Learning</h5>
				<p>
					Machines look for undetected patterns in the data collected and attempts to understand and identify a structure. The data is grouped and clustered together based on the patterns that are established.  
				</p>
				<h5>Reinforcement Learning </h5>
				<p>
					Enables a machine to learn within its environment through trial and error. It utilises feedback based on its actions and experiences to learn and adapt to the environment it is operating in.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Machine Learning origins date back to the 1950s when Alan Turning developed the Turning Test to determine if a computer could think like humans.  <br>
					Since then, there has been rapid growth in Machine Learning, especially over the past ten years. It has quickly been integrated into the software and hardware we use each day without much notice or understanding. It has become a central component for companies like Apple, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Google to grow their business models and further embed consumers into their ecosystems.<br> 
					Based on the data they collect from us on the searches we make, the music we listen to, the movies we watch, the photos we like, and the products we buy, they can build an in-depth profile on us all. The profiles they build can accurately target advertising and identify future product development opportunities to expand their businesses further.  <br>
					The use of Machine Learning extends beyond marketing and product development. Many companies are using Machine Learning today to streamline processes, enhance our experiences, and make the environment we operate in more secure.  <br>
					Examples of machine learning in our lives today include:
				</p>
				<h5>Biosecurity</h5>
				<p>
					Facial and/or fingerprint recognition is built into many mobile devices we use today to secure them from unauthorised use. Constantly each time we are unlocking the device, they collect more data to adjust and adapt over time to provide better protection and a faster response.  
				</p>
				<h5>Cybersecurity</h5>
				<p>
					Our banks monitor our transactions and look for patterns in the data that may be unusual to our daily spending habits to identify fraud. Daily, machine learning is used to sort through this data, identify suspicious behaviour and quickly identify it for a user to take action.    
				</p>
				<h5>Financial Services</h5>
				<p>
					Financial services companies are now introducing robo-advice to help customers understand their financial needs and make investment recommendations. These applications can quickly consume customer data, identify spending habits, and formulate a risk profile to develop a simple financial plan that can be easily actioned. Gone is the need to visit an actual financial planner in person.  
				</p>
				<p>
					In the coming years, we’ll see machine learning further integrated into the services we use and the products we buy. Through tools like IBM’s Watson, further advancements will be made and the technology integrated into our environments. This includes:  
				</p>
				<h5>Medical Diagnosis</h5>
				<p>
					By consuming medical tests, x-rays, and patient histories, machines will have the ability to identify and diagnose health issues faster and recommend to a medical practitioner a treatment to review and subscribe.  
				</p>
				<h5>Home Automation and Security</h5>
				<p>
					As the devices and software that we use in our homes become more closely integrated, it will provide the opportunity to increase the automation and security within our homes. Through the data which they collect, they will be able to:  
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Turn your lights based on the time you generally arrive home from work  </li>
					<li>Heat or cool your home throughout the year: and,   </li>
					<li>Identify when a package arrives, or a stranger enters </li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The possibilities with machine learning will only continue to grow with advancements in the technology. It will enable the capability for automatous cars, improvement in supply trains, and strategic military technology.   
				</p>
			<h2>5.1.2	What is the likely impact?</h2>
			<p>
				Machine Learning will have a significant impact on the way that will live our lives. It will bring about significant productivity improvements in our personal and professional environments. 
				These changes will be brought about through the automation of processes and provide people access to services that may have been previously out of reach.  <br>
				As a result of these changes, it will improve the world's population's quality of life. Its ongoing development will provide advancements as the capability is further embedded in technology and data consumption grows. It will enable information to be processed faster and more accurately than ever before and at a lower cost.  <br>
				These advancements in Machine Learning will also be a significant disrupter to society. It will, and already has impacted the workforce and the roles we play in our jobs. The speed at which a machine can consume and analyse data has already replaced and made redundant roles within the world’s economies.  <br>
				In the Future of Jobs Report commission by the World Economic Forum in 2018, it identified many roles at risk of being made redundant over the next four years due to Machine Learning advancements. These included Data Entry Clerks, Accountants, Cashiers, Telemarketers, Bank Tellers, and Assembly/Factory workers.  <br>
				As Machine Learning grows, this impact will only increase with other technology like robotics and artificial intelligence. Traditional white-collar roles once considered safe like Accountants, Lawyers, and Investment Bankers will see aspects of their roles replaced and automated.  
			</p>
			<h2>5.1.3	How will this affect you?  </h2>
			<p>
				The ongoing advancements with Machine Learning will have a profound impact on my life and the global community. It has, and continues, to bring about change associated with how we will live our lives. 
				Machine Learning will provide us with access to more information than ever before, which will give us more insight and the ability to take action faster than ever before. 
				These insights will be able to improve the quality of our lives.  <br>
				Across a range of industries, it will simplify and automate the services we access to make our lives easier. This includes: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Our ability to access financial services  </li>
				<li>Control the use and cost of utilities: and,  </li>
				<li>Access medical advice and treatment.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				While Machine Learning can improve our lives' quality, it does provide a threat to our livelihoods. The simplification and automation that Machine Learning provides can make redundant both white and blue-collar jobs within our economy in ways that that many people thought would be unimaginable.  <br>
				An example of this can be seen with a Western Australian Company called FastBricks. They have built a machine and software that can complete the laying of bricks within less than half the human being's time. Although the company and technology are still in its infancy, it can change the building industry dramatically.  <br>
				Moving into the future, what will be necessary to myself and others, is our ability to learn and adapt to this technology. It will be essential to be continuously learning and updating our skills to ensure that our skills remain relevant and up to date so that we can adjust to our environments due to the advancement of this technology.
