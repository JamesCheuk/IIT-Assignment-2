			<h2>4.2	Interview Questions </h2>
			<h3>4.2.1	Please tell us about your IT Work. What exactly do you do? </h3>
			<p>
				I am a business analyst working at Westpac in their business banking division. 
				I am a member of a delivery squad that is focused on improving the end-to-end processes associated with credit decisioning when a customer(s) applies for a new loan or looks to extend their existing. 
				The squad's primary focus is to reduce the average time for credit approval from five days to one. <br>
				As a business analyst, my responsibilities include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Working with my stakeholders to understand their business from a process and regulatory perspective </li>
				<li>Understanding the current business landscape and eliciting my stakeholders current and future requirement needs </li>
				<li>Understanding the current business landscape and eliciting my stakeholders current and future requirement needs </li>
				<li>Leading elaboration discussions within the squad to identify solutions that will support the squad to achieve its objectives, and:</li>
				<li>Partnering with the developers and testers throughout the development cycle to respond to their questions and further refine the stories as required </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>4.2.2	Please tell us about the industry you work in? </h3>
			<p>
				I'm a contractor and work in the financial services industry, primarily in banking and wealth management. I am currently working at Westpac, but I have also worked at Zurich and MLC in the past. 
				Although those businesses are classified as financial services, technology plays a meaningful way the company operates and engages with its customers. <br>
				In the past ten years, with the use of technology, there has been a significant shift to how these businesses interact with their customers. 
				Traditional face-to-face channels are slowly being replaced with digital interactions. This includes: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Websites and mobile applications to pay, transfer money and apply for new products</li>
				<li>Robo-advice for simple and straightforward financial advice rather than seeing a Financial Adviser at a branch or office. </li>
				<li>Chatbots to enable customers to ask simple questions and get an immediate answer. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				To remain competitive, all financial services companies need to invest in technology continually. From a customer perspective, they want access to easy and cheap services that are available to them on demand. 
			</p>
			<h4>Why are you a contractor? </h4>
			<p>
				Contracting provides me with greater flexibility. It allows me to work on projects of interest to me and continually develop my capabilities across different technology components. 
				As a permanent employee, I'd probably not be able to do this. <br>
				The day rate you receive as a contractor is much more attractive than that of a permanent employee. You are earning up to 40-50% more on an annual basis. 
				I've never had an issue finding work at the end of each assignment. Approximately 60% of the people working in my squad are contractors. 
			</p>
			<h3>4.2.3	What other kinds of work do you have to do? </h3>
			<p>
				As a squad member, we need to be prepared to support the other members of the team. Often I am called upon to support the team in various ways as we work through the sprint cycles towards delivery. <br>
				Primarily the activities that I am regularly required to support are testing and change management.<br>
				Testing involves the end-to-end testing of new capabilities that the squad has developed. The purpose is to ensure that it is operating per the requirements that have been captured from the business stakeholders. 
				The most common testing phases that I support are system testing, user testing, and post-implementation testing. <br>
				Change management covers the activities that need to be undertaken to ensure that the user(s) is ready and able to accept the new capability developed by the squad. 
				This can include writing release notes, documenting and updating processes and guides, or delivering training.
			</p>
			<h3>4.2.4	Who are all the different people you interact within your work? Please tell us about them. </h3>
			<p>
				Primarily on a day-to-day basis, within the squad, I work with the following roles.
			</p>
			<h5>Product Owner</h5>
			<p>
				At Westpac, the product owner owns the backlog of work that the squad is responsible for delivering. They need to be able to prioritise the order in which the work is delivered based on value to the business. <br>
				I need to work with the Product Owner daily to understand the stakeholders we need to engage with to gather requirements, seek direction on the new capability being developed, and approve the work the team will deliver.<br> 
				At a high level, they understand the business's broader strategy and how the work assigned to the squad fits into it. 
			</p>
			<h5>Scrum Master</h5>
			<p>
				Our squad’s scrum master is responsible for ensuring that we can work together as a team and that any roadblocks impacting the team are quickly resolved. 
				The scrum master runs the squad’s sprint planning and retrospectives, daily standards and acts as an escalation point for issues we can resolve together.<br>
				The scrum master is also one of the squad’s developers and is an active contributor to the work we are assigned to deliver. 
			</p>
			<h5>Developer</h5>
			<p>
				There are four developers within the squad, and we work quite closely together. I support them in understanding the requirements that I have captured from the product owner and the business stakeholders. 
				Together we elaborate the stories and acceptance criteria into a technology solution that will meet the business's needs. 
			</p>
			<h5>Tester</h5>
			<p>
				Within the squad, there is one test resource. His role is to test any new capability developed to ensure that it works as per the requirements that I have created. 
			</p>
			<h3>4.2.5	Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. </h3>
			<p>
				Outside of the squad, I need to engage with other IT professionals to help the team meet its sprint objectives. This includes: 
			</p>
			<h5>Solution Architect</h5>
			<p>
				The squad regular works with a solution architect when developing new capabilities or interfaces to our system. The solution architect helps design the overview solution approach to develop and ensure that it complies with its technology standards.
			</p>
			<h5>UX Designers</h5>
			<p>
				The squad regular works with a solution architect when developing new capabilities or interfaces to our system. The solution architect helps design the overview solution approach to develop and ensure that it complies with its technology standards.
			</p>
			<h3>4.2.6	What about your interactions with clients and investors. </h3>
			<p>
				No, I do not need to engage with clients and investors in my role. <br>
				My role requires me to work with Westpac's internal stakeholders who are responsible for the systems' operation and services the squad support. This includes legal, compliance, risk, product, and operations. 
			</p>
			<h3>4.2.7	What aspects of your work do you spend most of your time on? Please tell us about these. </h3>
			<p>
				Most of my time is spent eliciting business stakeholders' requirements and writing the users stories that will be used to support the identification and development of a technical solution. <br>
				This can be an extensive exercise. Both requirements and acceptance criteria need to clearly articulate all the behaviour components the solution will need to meet. 
			</p>
			<h3>4.2.8	Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? </h3>
			<p>
				The most challenging part of my role is stakeholder management. For each initiative, you must work with multiple stakeholders from across the business to ensure the requirements you capture cover all the necessary regulatory and service obligations that any solution needs to meet. <br>
				In gathering the requirements from the stakeholders, you’ll often come across a level of conflict. This conflict can relate to multiple aspects of the initiative, including: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The scope of work that needs to be undertaken </li>
				<li>A misalignment in understanding the minimum requirements that may need to be met: and/or, </li>
				<li>A misalignment in understanding the minimum requirements that may need to be met: and/or, </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Through the process, I need to make sure that their conflicts are mutually resolved for the initiative to move forward.  
			</p>
			<h3>4.2.9	Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? </h3>
			<p>
				Due to commercial confidentiality reasons, I can’t share any examples of the work I need to deliver that has been used to develop a technical solution. <br>
				Attached below is a simple example of a User Story and the Acceptance Criteria that would be similar to what I would need to document.
