			<h1>Triggered Reports - Cybersecurity</h1>
			<h2>5.3.1	What does it do? </h2>
			<p>
				Cybersecurity is the act of protecting systems, networks and programs from cybercrime, cyber-attack and cyberterrorism. There are lots of valuable data worth protecting located in personal devices all the way to servers and databases of corporations, which if stolen can result in serious consequences for those whose data is now exposed. Cybersecurity aims to protect these through the use of software and user awareness of the risks and preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of a cybersecurity breach. <br>
				Traditionally, cybersecurity’s biggest challenge has been malware and phishing. Malware stands for malicious software, which is introduced to the user’s device through opening suspicious email attachments or downloading from untrustworthy websites. Malware include viruses, trojans, spyware and ransomware. Phishing is where the cybercriminal pretends to be a legitimate organisation and asks the user for sensitive information, such as bank account details by directing the user to a website that looks like the real one. The tools used to combat these challenges include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>firewalls which shields the computer or network from malicious or unwanted network traffic,  </li>
				<li>anti-virus software which scans files in the computer or network against a list of known malwares and quarantines or removes any files that contains code that matches a known malware, and  </li>
				<li>educating the user on the risks of a data breach and introducing them to preventative measures to keep their computers and networks safe, such as not opening suspicious attachments from unknown emails and keeping operating systems and antivirus software up to date. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As the means of transferring electronic data increases, along with a rapidly evolving cyber threat, there more chances there are for cybercriminals to find ways to obtain sensitive data. With more and more pathways to transfer electronic data, and a change in methodology and targets chosen for cyber attackers, the current cybersecurity measures are no longer sufficient to protect all the new things being connected to the network. The new challenges that cybersecurity face include: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>overwhelming meaningless security alerts as the volume of data transfer increases, </li>
				<li>“zero day” exploits – malware developed to exploit vulnerabilities in software or hardware before the vulnerabilities are fixed in future patches, </li>
				<li>Man-in-the-Middle attacks (MiM) – where the cybercriminal intercepts the data being transferred in the communication channels, </li>
				<li>Cloud-based applications and BYOD which traditional firewalls and security measures aren’t sufficient to protect. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In order to ensure a safe and secure cyber space for the future, new technologies are being developed to combat the increasing and varying cyber-attacks. The new technologies that is being introduced to strengthen cybersecurity include: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics – developed to handle the meaningless security alerts, it is designed to monitor and identify suspicious transactions or activity. It operates on the basis that unusual behaviour equates to bad things happening. The behaviours that get analysed are obtained through various means, such as bioprinting and creating behavioural profiles of people and how they use things, </li>
				<li>Next Generation Breach Detection – which combines machine learning with behavioural analysis to identify “zero day” breaches. This works by understanding behaviour patterns of its users and machines and picks out strange movements it deems suspicious, </li>
				<li>Virtual Dispersive Networks (VDN) – used to counter MiM attacks, where the transmitted message is split into numerous encrypted parts and sent through numerous channels so the attack will not be able to obtain a complete message even if they intercept anything. </li>
				<li>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) – an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorisation data between parties, which is normally used with encryption and intrusion detection alert systems to protect data stored in cloud storages. What this means is that all traffic is logged and monitored, files and information embedded with security tags to track their movement so that any suspicious movement will trigger alarms. </li>
			</ul>
			<h2>5.3.2	What is the likely impact? </h2>
			<p>
				With diversifying methods of attack from cybercriminals, the introduction new technologies to cope with these attacks will change the way we access our sensitive information and services. New technology will require development, setup, maintenance and updates to keep up with the evolving cyber-attacks and this impact will be seen in the form of increased spending by governments and corporations on cybersecurity, as more and more sensitive data and important infrastructure become connected to the networks that require protection. <br>
				Most of these changes will happen behind the scenes without the average user being aware of the changes, they may not even be aware that the way they use their devices is being monitored to create a behavioural profile to help protect them from cybercriminals. The biggest change will definitely apply to the cybersecurity experts. Where they may only be required to set up firewalls, antivirus software and other basic forms of defences, they will now need to learn and gain proficiency to apply the new technologies to the corporations they are hired to protect and respond to the varying forms of attack that test their defences.<br> 
				The increasing threat posed by cybercriminals, along with the ever-growing list of things that get connected to the cyber networks will require many more cybersecurity professionals than ever before. There is a severe shortage of job-ready cybersecurity workers in Australia in the short to medium term, and with the continuing evolution of cyber-attacks this demand is expected to remain which will result in creating many more positions for cybersecurity professionals. 
			</p>
			<h2>5.3.3	How will this affect you? </h2>
			<p>
				Cybersecurity will only become more important for us as we become more connected to the networks than ever before. The amount of data we transfer on a daily basis from our usage of social media platforms (Reddit, Facebook, TikTok to name some), emails, online shopping and work exposes us to those who have malicious intentions should they acquire sensitive information about us. The consequences of that happening results in something called identity theft, where the malicious user pretends to be us and access our various accounts causing us devastating financial loss.  <br>
				The various corporations that we have accounts with will introduce security measures to assist us in keeping our accounts safe, such as requiring authenticators (two factor, temporary one-time codes sent via SMS or email) in addition to the standard password and/or PIN that we use. It will result in extra steps before we can get to the sensitive data we want to access. These same corporations will also be building our behavioural profiles based on the way we access and use the sensitive data stored with them, which may result in messages from them when we do something unusual to check it is us who did the deed. It is a good thing to know that they have our backs and are looking out for us, however the downside is that these profiles may be sold, which is why we see online advertisements that are for things we have previously browsed online. <br>
				Ultimately, the new cybersecurity technologies being introduced to protect us and our sensitive data will go largely unnoticed by the average user. As long as the users are kept informed of the risks and preventative measures available to them, and they take the standard steps in protecting their data (keeping antivirus software updated, firewalls set up properly, not opening suspicious emails) it will be sufficient.
